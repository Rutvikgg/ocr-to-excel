This project aims to automate the process of extracting text from images or scanned documents using mindee OCR and then organizing the extracted information into an Excel spreadsheet.

## Installation

1. Install mindee OCR: Follow the installation instructions for your operating system on the official [Tesseract GitHub repository](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).

2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pytesseract
   pip install openpyxl
   pip install Ôªøet-xmlfile
   pip install numpy
   pip install opencv-python
   pip install packaging
   pip install pillow
   pip install mindee
   ```

## Usage

1. Place your images or scanned documents in the `input_images` directory.

2. Run the OCR script:
   ```bash
   python ocr_to_excel.py
   ```

3. The script will process the images, extract text using Tesseract OCR, and create an Excel file (`output_data.xlsx`) in the `output_excel` directory.

## Configuration

- Adjust Tesseract OCR settings or language options in the script (`ocr_to_excel.py`) based on your specific requirements.

Welcome to our OCR-based data extraction project! üöÄ

## Overview

This project streamlines the extraction of text from images or scanned documents using mindee OCR. The extracted information is then organized into a structured Excel spreadsheet, providing a convenient way to manage and analyze data.

## Installation

1. **Install mindee OCR:** Follow the installation instructions for your operating system on the official [Tesseract GitHub repository](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).

2. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare your documents:**
   Place your images or scanned documents in the `input_images` directory.

2. **Run the OCR script:**
   ```bash
   python ocr_to_excel.py
   ```

3. **Retrieve results:**
   The script processes the images, extracts text using Tesseract OCR, and generates an Excel file (`output_data.xlsx`) in the `output_excel` directory.

## Configuration

Adjust Tesseract OCR settings or language options in the script (`ocr_to_excel.py`) to suit your specific requirements.

## Contributions

We welcome contributions! Feel free to submit bug reports, feature requests, or pull requests to enhance the project.

## Project Overview

Our project addresses the significant productivity bottleneck associated with manual data entry by harnessing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology. We have developed an efficient solution for receipt management that automates the extraction of data from scanned receipts, organizing it into a structured Excel spreadsheet. This not only enhances accuracy and efficiency but also simplifies the tedious process of transcribing receipts, allowing for seamless organization and analysis of financial data.

## Problem Statement

Through our survey, we identified a lack of automation in the financial processes of small and medium-sized businesses, resulting in substantial manual labor. Our primary objective is to provide an effective solution for automating invoice management, reducing labor costs for small businesses, and making bookkeeping more accessible.

## Methodology

1. **OCR Integration:** Implement a robust OCR system capable of accurately extracting text from scanned receipt images.

2. **Receipt Segmentation:** Develop algorithms to identify and isolate individual items on the receipt, including product names, prices, and quantities.

3. **Data Extraction:** Extract relevant information from the segmented receipt elements, including item names, prices, dates, and vendor details.

4. **Data Validation:** Implement validation mechanisms to ensure the accuracy and reliability of extracted data, minimizing errors and inconsistencies.

5. **Excel Conversion:** Design a module to transform the extracted data into a structured Excel spreadsheet format, facilitating easy storage, organization, and analysis.

## Survey Findings

Our survey revealed that many small and medium-sized businesses lack automation in their finances, leading to excessive manual labor. This project aims to alleviate this burden and streamline bookkeeping processes.

## Challenges and Future Goals

1. **Format Support:** Addressing challenges related to varying invoice formats, ensuring optimal performance for non-standard layouts.

2. **Language Constraints:** Enhancing OCR tools to support multilingual formats and diverse languages for broader usability.

3. **Handwriting Recognition:** Future goals include improving OCR systems to recognize handwritten elements on invoices through advanced machine learning algorithms and expanded datasets.

## Usage

1. **Installation:** Follow the installation steps in the [Installation](#installation) section of the readme.

2. **Execution:** Place scanned receipt images in the `input_images` directory and run the OCR script:
   ```bash
   python ocr_to_excel.py
   ```
   The script utilizes Tesseract OCR and various computer vision techniques.
   We are using puthon , MySQL , tesseract, mindee API, pycham . tkinter for this
